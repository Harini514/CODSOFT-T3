Overview of the Project:

This project is a simple Python implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." It allows a user to play against the computer.

Objective

Create an interactive game where the user competes against the computer.
Use basic game logic to determine the winner.
Provide a simple, engaging user experience with clear feedback.


Components

1. User Input
The user is prompted to choose between "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
Input is validated to ensure it's one of the valid choices. (Optional enhancement: Handle invalid input gracefully.)
2. Computer Selection
The computer generates a random choice from the same options: "rock," "paper," or "scissors."
Randomness is achieved using Python's random module.
3. Game Logic
Rules of the game are implemented:
Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beat paper.
Paper beats rock.
A tie is declared if both choices are the same.
The result (win/lose/tie) is determined by comparing the user's choice to the computer's choice.
4. Display Results
Both the user's and computer's choices are displayed.
A message declares whether the user wins, loses, or ties.


Flow of the Game

The user makes their choice.
The computer generates a random choice.
The program compares the choices using the game's rules.
The result is displayed, including the choices and the winner.


Features

Interactivity: The game waits for the user input, making it interactive.
Randomness: The computer's choice is unpredictable, adding excitement.
Immediate Feedback: Results are displayed instantly, keeping the game engaging.
